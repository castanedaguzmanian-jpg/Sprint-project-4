This project is based on the publicly available Instacart dataset originally released in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. 
The dataset was modified to reduce its size and intentionally includes missing values and duplicates while preserving the original data distributions.
The objective of this project was to clean and prepare the data, then analyze customer shopping behavior on the Instacart platform. 
The analysis focused on identifying purchasing patterns, customer habits, and product trends that could support business and marketing decisions.
The project involved:
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values and duplicates)
Exploratory data analysis
Visualization of key insights through clear and well-labeled charts
Interpretation of results and written explanations using Markdown in Jupyter Notebook
The final output provides insights into how customers interact with the platform and how purchasing behavior varies across products and orders.
Tools used: Python (pandas, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook
